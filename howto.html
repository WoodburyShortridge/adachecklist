          <h1>How to Use this Checklist</h1>
          <h2>Get Organized</h2>
          <p>One person can conduct a survey, but it’s easier with two people.
            One person can take measurements and the other person can fill out
            the checklist and take photos.</p>
          <h2>Obtain Floor Plans</h2>
          <p>A floor plan or sketch helps the surveyors get oriented and know
            how many elements, such as drinking fountains and entrances, there
            are and where they are. If plans are not available, sketch the
            layout of interior and exterior spaces. </p>
          <h2>Make Copies of the Checklist</h2>
          <p>Determine how many copies of each section of the checklist you
            need. For example, most facilities have more than one toilet room.</p>
          <h2>Gather Tools</h2>
          <ul id="tools">
            <li>Checklist</li>
            <li>Clipboard makes it easier to write on the checklist</li>
            <li>Tape measure</li>
            <li>Electronic or carpenter’s level - 24 inches</li>
            <li>Door pressure gauge or fish scale for measuring door-opening
              force</li>
            <li>Digital camera</li>
            <li>Bag to hold these items</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Conduct the Survey </h2>
          <h3>Start Outside</h3>
          <p>Start from site arrival points such as drop-off areas and public
            sidewalks and determine if there is an accessible route to an
            accessible entrance. If there is a parking lot or garage check for
            the correct number of accessible parking spaces, including
            van-accessible spaces. Is there an accessible route from the
            accessible parking spaces to an accessible entrance? Next survey the
            entrances. If there is an accessible entrance, determine if there
            are signs at inaccessible entrances directing people to the
            accessible entrance. Go inside and continue through the facility and
            the checklist.</p>
          <h3>Keep Good Notes</h3>
          <p>Write on the front of each checklist where you are surveying. You
            may end up with six toilet room checklists. When you get back to
            your office you’ll want to know which one is the checklist for the
            first floor women’s room. If there isn’t an accessible entrance
            you’ll want to indicate how many steps there are and how much space
            is available to install a ramp or lift. This is a good time to take
            photographs.</p>
          <h3>Take Good Measurements</h3>
          <p>When in doubt write it down. It’s better to have too much information than not enough. Even if something is in compliance it’s helpful to have exact measurements.</p>
          <h4>Parking Spaces</h4>
          <div class="row">
            <img class="col-xs-5 col-md-4" src="img/howto/measureparking.png" alt="two men are measuring the width of a driveway">

          <h4>Door Opening Force</h4>

            <img class="col-xs-5 col-md-4" src="img/howto/pushdoor.png" alt="man pushing a door open">
            <p class="col-xs-7 col-md-8 howtodesc">If you’re using a door pressure gauge, place it where you would push open the door.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <img class="col-xs-5 col-md-4" src="img/howto/pulldoor.png" alt="man pulling on a door handle">
            <p class="col-xs-7 col-md-8 howtodesc">If you’re using a fish scale, place it where you would pull open the door.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Accessible Slopes</h4>
          <img class="col-xs-5 col-md-4 p-l-0" src="img/howto/measureslope.png" alt="Diagram of a man measuring the slope of a ramp" id="slope">
          <p>You can measure slope with a 24 inch level and a tape measure. Put the level on the surface in the direction you are measuring. Put one end at the high point of the surface and raise the other end so that the bubble is in the middle of the level’s gauge. The level is now level. Measure the distance between the end of the level at its bottom point and the surface. </p>
          <p>For a ramp the maximum running slope allowed is 1:12. That means
            for every inch of height change there should be at least 12 inches
            of ramp run. If the distance between the bottom of the level and the
            ramp surface is 2 inches or less, then the slope is 1:12 or less
            (2:24 = 1:12 and 1.5:24 = 1:16 which is a more gradual slope than
            1:12). If the distance is greater than 2 inches, the ramp is too
            steep. For example, if the distance is 3 inches, then the slope is
            1:8 (3:24 = 1:8 which is a steeper slope than 1:12). </p>
          <p>For the parts of an accessible route that aren’t a ramp, the
            maximum running slope allowed is 1:20. That means for every inch of
            height change there must be at least 20 inches of route run. The
            distance from the bottom edge of the level to the surface should be
            no more than 1.2 inches (1.2:24 = 1:20).</p>
          <p>For the cross slope of an accessible route the maximum slope
            allowed is 1:48. The distance from the bottom edge of the level to
            the surface should be no more than ½ inch (.5:24 = 1:48). The cross
            slope of an accessible route is the slope that is perpendicular to
            the direction of pedestrian travel.</p>
          <p>Slopes may also be measured using a digital level. Be sure to read
            the instructions. Measure with the percent calculation rather than
            the degrees calculation. For a ramp the maximum running slope
            allowed is 8.33% (8.33% is a 1:12 slope). For an accessible route
            without a ramp the maximum running slope allowed is 5% (1:20). For
            the cross slope of an accessible route the maximum slope allowed is
            2.083% (1:48).</p>
          <h3>Check that You Got Everything</h3>
          <p>Before you leave the site review all the checklists. Make sure you
            know which checklist goes with which entrance and which toilet room
            and that you’ve got all the information you need. It is better to do
            it now than to have to go back.</p>
          <h2>After the Survey</h2>
          <h3>List Barriers and Solutions</h3>
          <p>Consider the solutions listed beside each question on the checklist
            and add your own ideas. Consult with building contractors and
            equipment suppliers to estimate the costs for making modifications.</p>
          <h3>Develop a Plan</h3>
          <p>State and local governments were required to develop a Transition
            Plan six months after the ADA went into effect (1993!). Conducting a
            current survey is a good opportunity to update the plan.</p>
          <p>Although places of public accommodation are not required to have a
            plan, the Department of Justice recommends one: "...Such a
            plan...could serve as evidence of a good faith effort to comply..."</p>
          <p>Prioritize items, make a timeline, decide who is responsible to
            carry out the plan and develop a budget.</p>
          <h3>Make Changes</h3>
          <p>Use the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design. Check whether
            local and state building codes require greater accessibility when
            alterations are undertaken.</p>
          <h3>Follow Up</h3>
          <p>Review the implementation plan each year to evaluate whether more
            access improvements have become readily achievable.</p>
