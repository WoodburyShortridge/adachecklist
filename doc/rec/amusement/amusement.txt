(Exceptions in load or unload areas and on amusement ride:
1. If a ramp is part of the accessible route and it is structurally or operationally infeasible for the slope to be no greater than 1:12, i.e. for every inch of height change there are at least 12 inches of curb ramp run, the slope may be no greater than 1:8.

A17 If the wheelchair space is entered only from the side, is there sufficient maneuvering clearance for a person in a wheelchair to enter and exit the ride?
yes or no
(The amount of clear space needed within the ride, and the size and position of the opening are interrelated. A 32 inch clear opening will not provide sufficient width when entered through a turn into an amusement ride. Additional space for maneuvering and a wider door will be needed where a side opening is centered on the ride. For example, where a 42 inch opening is provided, a minimum clear space of 60 inches in length and 36 inches in depth is needed to ensure adequate space for maneuvering.)
