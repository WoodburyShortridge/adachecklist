Supplemental Requirements - Play Areas
Comments
Possible Solutions
Play Areas  (2010 Standards - 206, 240 & 1008) Note: Play areas for children under age 2 and play areas in family child care facilities where the proprietor resides do 
not have to comply.

Is there an accessible route 
to the entrance of the play 
area?

If there are separate play 
areas within a site for specific 
age groups, is there an 
accessible route to each play 
area?

Use the checklist for Priority 
1: Approach & Entrance for 
all accessible route 
questions.

Ground Level Play 
Components
Is there an accessible route 
to at least one of each type 
of ground level play 
component?

Notes: 
1. Ground level play 
components are items that 
can be approached and 
exited at ground level. 
Examples include rockers, 
swings, diggers, and stand-
alone slides. When 
distinguishing between 
different types of ground 
level play components, 
consider the general 
experience provided. 
Experiences include, but are 
not limited to, rocking, 
swinging, climbing, spinning, 
and sliding.  A spiral slide 
may provide a slightly 
different experience from a 
straight slide, but sliding is 
the general experience and 
therefore a spiral slide is not 
considered a different type 
of play component from a 
straight slide. 
? Yes   ? No





If there are elevated play 
components, is there an 
accessible route to at least 
the following number and 
type of ground level play 
components?  See chart 
below.

Notes: 
1. The intent is to provide a 
variety of experiences for 
children who want to remain 
in their wheelchair or with 
their walker or other mobility 
device and who choose not 
to transfer to elevated play 
components.
2 Where a large play area 
includes two or more 
composite play structures 
designed for the same age 
group, use the total number 
of elevated play components 
on all the composite play 
structures to determine the 
additional number and types 
of ground level play 
components to provide on an 
accessible route.
3. If ramps provide access to 
at least 50 percent of the 
elevated play components - 
which must include at least 3 
different play types - then 
the additional ground level 
components specified in the 
chart are not required.
? Yes   ? No

Amber, 
Can you move the chart to under 
the notes in this question? I've 
tried unsuccessfully, it messes 
up the row formatting.



If there are one or more 
water play component(s) is 
there an accessible route to 
at least one of each type of 
ground level component?

Note: If the accessible route 
is submerged, it is not 
required to be slip resistant, 
the running slope may be 
steeper than 1:12 and the 
cross slope may be steeper 
than 1:48.
? Yes   ? No





If there is a soft contained 
play structure with three or 
fewer entry point, is there an 
accessible route to at least 
one entry point?

It there are four or more 
entry points, are there 
accessible routes to at least 
two entry points?

Notes: 
1. A soft contained play area 
is a play structure made of 
one or more components on 
which a person enters a fully 
enclosed play environment 
that uses pliable materials 
such as plastic, soft padding 
and fabric. 

2. Transfer systems may be 
part of the accessible route.

Measurement:





On the accessible route 
connecting accessible ground 
level play components if 
handrails are required:

surface no less than 20 
inches and no greater than 
28 inches above the ramp 
surface?

Is the handrail gripping 
surface:
Circular with an outside 
diameter of at least .95inch 
and no more than 1.55 
inches?
Or
