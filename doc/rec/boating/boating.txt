Recreational Boating Facilities should be accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.
Boating Facilities (Recreational) (2010 Standards – 206, 235  & 1003)

B1 Is there an accessible route to the entrance of the boating facility?  
(Use the checklist for Priority 1: Approach & Entrance.)
yes or no
Solutions: Add a ramp
Regrade to 1:20 maximum slope
Widen route
Change route surface
Add a platform lift, limited use/limited application elevator or a regular elevator

B2 Boat slips 
Where boat slips are provided are there an adequate number of accessible slips?
yes or no
Total slips:
Accessible slips:
(If slips are not demarcated by length, count each 40 feet of slip edge along the pier perimeter as one slip.
if the total splits is between 1 - 25 you need 1 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 26 - 50 you need 2 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 51 - 100 you need 3 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 101 - 150 you need 4 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 151 - 300 you need 5 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 301 - 400 you need 6 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 401 - 500 you need 7 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 501 - 600 you need 8 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 601 - 700 you need 9 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 701 - 800 you need 10 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 801 - 900 you need 11 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 901 - 1000 you need 12 accessible splits
if the total splits is between 1001 and over - 700 you need 12 plus 1 for each 100 or fraction accessible splits)
Solutions: Create accessible slips

B3 Are the accessible boat slips dispersed among the different types of boat slips?
yes or no
(Accessible boat slips must be dispersed throughout the various types of slips, but a facility does not have to provide more accessible boat slips than required in the table. Accessible slips may be grouped on one pier if the requirement for different types of slips is met. Types could include shallow-water or deep water; transient or longer-term lease; covered or uncovered; and whether slips are equipped with features such as telephone, water, electricity, or cable connections.)
Solution: Relocate accessible slips

B4 Is there an accessible route to the accessible boat slips?
yes or no
Use the checklist for Priority 1: Approach and Entrance
(To deal with varying water levels, exceptions apply when gangways are part of the accessible route.  A gangway is a variable-sloped pedestrian walkway that links a fixed structure or land with a floating structure.
Exceptions:
1. Gangway rises may be greater than 30 inches. Therefore gangways may be any length and no intermediate landings are required.
2. Gangway slopes may be greater than 1:12 if the total length of a gangway or series of gangways serving as part of the accessible route is at least 80 feet.
3. Gangway slopes may be greater than 1:12 if the facility contains fewer than 25 boat slips and the total length of the gangway or series of gangway serving as part of the accessible route is at least 30 feet.
4. Level landings are not required where gangways connect to transition plates. A transition plate is a sloped pedestrian surface at the end of a gangway.
5. Where gangways and transition plates connect, handrail extensions are not required.
6. If there are handrail extensions on gangways or transition plates, the extensions are not required to be parallel with the ground surface.  
7. Changes in level ¼ to ½ inch high, beveled with a slope no steeper than 1:20 are permitted on gangway surfaces.
Note: When gangways, transition plates and floating piers and platforms are part of an accessible route, the cross slope requirement of 1:48 maximum is measured when they are in the static position, i.e. absence of movement that results from waves and wind.)
Solution: Add a ramp
Regrade to 1:20 maximum slope
Widen route
Change route surface
Add a platform lift, limited use/limited application elevator or a regular elevator 

B5 If there are transition plates is the slope of transition plates no greater than 1:20?
yes or no
Measurement:
If the slope is greater than 1:20 is a there a landing at the end of the transition plate?
yes or no
Measurement:
Solution: Regrade to 1:20 maximum slope

B6 Is there clear pier space at the accessible boat slips that is:
At least as long as the slip by at least 60 inches wide?
yes or no
Measurement:
Or At least 36 inches wide for a length no greater than 24 inches, if multiple 36 inch wide segments are separated by segments that are at least 60 inches wide and at least 60 inches long? 
yes or no
Measurement:
(Clear pier space may be perpendicular to the boat slip if the space extends the width of the slip and the facility has at least one accessible boat slip parallel to the pier.)
Solutions: Add clear space
Reconfigure clear space

B7 For every 10 feet of linear pier edge serving the slips, is there a continuous clear opening at least 60 inches wide?
yes or no
Measurement:
If there is edge protection at the clear opening, is it no higher than 4 inches and no wider than 2 inches?
yes or no
Measurement:
Solutions: Add clear openings
Relocate clear openings
Change edge protection

B8 If there are controls and operating mechanisms, such as hose bibbs, water supply hoses, outlets for electrical power, telephones, or cable TV:
Are they on an accessible route?
yes or no
Is there a clear floor space next to each that is at least 30 inches by at least 48 inches?
yes or no
Measurement:
Are operable parts no higher than 48 inches and no lower than 15 inches above the surface?*
(If constructed before 3/15/2012 and a side reach is provided operable parts may be no higher than 54 inches and no lower than 9 inches )
yes or no
Measurement:
Solutions: Relocate controls and/or operating mechanisms
Relocate route
Add clear floor space
Change height of controls and/or operating mechanisms

B9 If there are cleats or other securement devices serving the accessible boat slips:
Are they on an accessible route?
yes or no
Is there a clear floor space next to each that is at least 30 inches by at least 48 inches?
yes or no
Measurement:
(Cleats and other boat securement devices at accessible slips can be any height; they do not have to comply with reach range requirements.)
Solutions: Relocate securement devices
Add clear floor space

B10 Boarding piers at boat launch ramps
Where boarding piers are provided at boat launch ramps, are at least 5 percent, but no fewer than one, accessible?
yes or no
Number:
(A boarding pier is where a boat is temporarily moored for embarking and disembarking. A boat launch ramp is a sloped surface for launching and retrieving trailered boats to and from the water. For boarding piers that are not part of a boat launch ramp, use the boat slips section.)
Solution: Create accessible boarding piers

B11 Is there an accessible route to and connecting the accessible boarding piers? 
yes or no
Use the checklist for Priority 1: Approach & Entrance.
(To deal with varying water levels, exceptions apply when an accessible route connects to floating piers. 
Exceptions:
1. Where the accessible route serving a floating boarding pier or skid pier is within a boat launch ramp, that portion does not have to comply with ramp requirements.
2. Gangway rises may be greater than 30 inches. Therefore gangways may be any length and no intermediate landings are required.  A gangway is a variable-sloped pedestrian walkway that links a fixed structure or land with a floating structure.
3. Gangway slopes may be greater than 1:12 if the total length of a gangway or series of gangways serving as part of the accessible route is at least 30 feet.
4. Landings are not required where gangways connect to transition plates. A transition plate is a sloped pedestrian surface at the end of a gangway.
5. Where gangways and transition plates connect, handrail extensions are not required.
6. If there are handrail extensions on gangways or transition plates, the extensions are not required to be parallel with the ground surface.
7. Changes in level ¼ to ½ inch high, beveled with a slope no steeper than 1:20 are permitted on gangway surfaces.)
Solutions: Add a ramp
Regrade to 1:20 maximum slope
Lengthen gangway
Widen route
Change route surface
Add a platform lift, limited use/ limited application elevator or a regular elevator
