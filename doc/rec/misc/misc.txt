T2 Is there at least one wheelchair space at team or player seating areas?
yes or no
Measurement:
Solution:Add wheelchair space

T3 If there is a single wheelchair space, is it at least 36 inches wide?

T7 Do wheelchair spaces adjoin, but not overlap, accessible routes?
yes or no
Solution:Alter spaces

T8 Do wheelchair spaces not overlap circulation paths?
yes or no
Note: The term "circulation paths" means aisle width required by applicable building or life safety codes for the specific assembly occupancy. Where the circulation path provided is wider than the required aisle width, the wheelchair space may intrude into that portion of the circulation path that is provided in excess of the required aisle width.
Solution:Alter spaces

Solutions:Add a ramp
Regrade to 1:20 maximum slope
Widen route
