          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <h2 id="program">What is Program Accessibility?</h2>
          <p>State and local governments must ensure that services, programs and
            activities, when viewed in their entirety, are accessible to people
            with disabilities. This is part of public entities’ program
            accessibility obligations. Alterations to older buildings may be
            needed to ensure program accessibility. Generally this is a greater
            obligation than “readily achievable barrier removal” the standard
            that applies to public accommodations. State and local governments
            are not required to take any action that would result in undue
            financial and administrative burdens.</p>
          <p>State and local governments’ ADA obligations for program
            accessibility are in the Department of Justice’s ADA title II
            regulations 28 CFR Part 35.150.</p>
          <hr class="row">
          <!-- what -->
          <h2 id="what">What is Readily Achievable Barrier
            Removal?</h2>
          <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires public
            accommodations (businesses and non-profit organizations) to provide
            goods and services to people with disabilities on an equal basis
            with the rest of the public.</p>
          <p>Businesses and non-profit organizations that serve the public are
            to remove architectural barriers when it is “readily achievable” to
            do so; in other words, when barrier removal is “easily
            accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or
            expense.”</p>
          <p>The decision of what is readily achievable is made considering the
            size, type, and overall finances of the public accommodation and the
            nature and cost of the access improvements needed. Barrier removal
            that is difficult now may be readily achievable in the future as
            finances change.</p>
          <p>This checklist is intended to assist public accommodations as the
            first step in a planning process for readily achievable barrier
            removal.</p>
          <p>Public accommodations’ ADA obligations for barrier removal can be
            found in the Department of Justice’s ADA Title III regulations <a href="http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleIII_2010/titleIII_2010_regulations.htm"

          <!-- priorities -->
          <h2 id="priorities">Priorities for Accessible Facilities</h2>
          <p>The checklist follows the four priorities in the Department of
            Justice ADA title III regulations. These priorities are equally
            applicable to state and local government facilities.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Priority 1 - Accessible approach and entrance</li>
            <li>Priority 2 - Access to goods and services</li>
            <li>Priority 3 - Access to public toilet rooms</li>
            <li>Priority 4 - Access to other items such as water fountains and
              public telephones</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- standards -->
          <h2 id="standards">2010 ADA Standards for Accessible
            Design</h2>
          <p>This checklist is based on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible
            Design (2010 Standards). The specifications are in this checklist to
            help determine what may be readily achievable barrier removal for
            existing facilities. This checklist does not include all sections of
            the 2010 Standards. For example there are no questions about patient
            rooms in hospitals or guest rooms in hotels. Consult the 2010
            Standards for situations not covered in the checklist. Full
            compliance with the 2010 Standards is required only for new
            construction and alterations. The web address for the 2010 Standards
            is in the Resources section.</p>
          <hr class="row">
          <!-- safeharbor -->
          <h2 id="safeharbor">Safe Harbor – Construction Prior to
            March 15, 2012</h2>
          <p>Elements in facilities built or altered before March 15, 2012 that
            comply with the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (1991
            Standards) are not required to be modified to specifications in the
            2010 Standards. For example, the 1991 Standards allow 54 inches
            maximum for a side reach range to a control such as the operating
            part of a paper towel dispenser. The 2010 Standards lower that side
            reach range to 48 inches maximum. If a paper towel dispenser was
            installed prior to March 15, 2012 with the highest operating part at
            54 inches, the paper towel dispenser does not need to be lowered to
            48 inches. Since the dispenser complies with the 1991 Standards,
            that Standard provides a “safe harbor.”</p>
          <hr class="row">
          <!-- newele -->
          <h2 id="newele">Elements in the 2010 ADA Standards Not
            in the 1991</h2>
          <p>The 2010 Standards contain elements that are not in the 1991
            Standards. These elements include recreation facilities such as
            swimming pools, team and player seating, accessible routes in court
            sports facilities, saunas and steam rooms, fishing piers, play
            areas, exercise machines, golf facilities, miniature golf
            facilities, amusement rides, shooting facilities with firing
            positions, and recreational boating facilities. Because these
            elements are not in the 1991 Standards, they are not subject to the
            safe harbor exemption. Public accommodations must remove
            architectural barriers to these items when it is readily achievable
            to do so. For example, a hotel must determine whether it is readily
            achievable to make its swimming pool accessible by installing a
            lift, a sloped entry or both as specified in the 2010 Standards.
            State and local governments must consider accessibility improvements
            to these recreation areas to ensure “program accessibility.” For
            example a town must look at its play areas and determine which
            should be made accessible.</p>
          <hr class="row">
          <!-- whatnot -->
          <h2 id="whatnot">What this Checklist is Not</h2>
          <p>The ADA title II and III regulations require more than program
            accessibility and barrier removal. The regulations include
            requirements for nondiscriminatory policies and practices and for
            the provision of auxiliary aids and services, such as sign language
            interpreters for people who are deaf and material in Braille for
            people who are blind. This checklist does not cover those
            requirements.</p>
          <p>Since this checklist does not include all of the 2010 Standards it
            is not intended to determine compliance for new construction or
            alterations.</p>
          <hr class="row">
          <!-- public -->
          <h2 id="public">What are Public Accommodations?</h2>
          <p>Under the ADA public accommodations are private entities that own,
            lease, lease to or operate a place of public accommodation. This
            means that both a landlord who leases space in a building to a
            tenant and the tenant who operates a place of public accommodation
            have responsibilities to remove barriers.</p>
          <p>A place of public accommodation is a facility whose operations
            affect commerce and fall within at least one of the following 12
            categories:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Places of lodging (e.g., inns, hotels, motels, except for
              owner-occupied establishments renting fewer than six rooms)</li>
            <li>Establishments serving food or drink (e.g. , restaurants and
              bars)</li>
            <li>Places of exhibition or entertainment (e.g. , motion picture
              houses, theaters, concert halls, stadiums)</li>
            <li>Places of public gathering (e.g. , auditoriums, convention
              centers, lecture halls)</li>
            <li>Sales or rental establishments (e.g. , bakeries, grocery stores,
              hardware stores, shopping centers)</li>
            <li>Service establishments (e.g. , laundromats, dry-cleaners, banks,
              barber shops, beauty shops, travel services, shoe repair services,
              funeral parlors, gas stations, offices of accountants or lawyers,
              pharmacies, insurance offices, professional offices of health care
              providers, hospitals)</li>
            <li>Public transportation terminals, depots, or stations (not
              including facilities relating to air transportation)</li>
            <li>Places of public display or collection (e.g. , museums,
              libraries, galleries)</li>
            <li>Places of recreation (e.g. , parks, zoos, amusement parks)Places
              of education </li>
            <li>Places of education (e.g. , nursery schools, elementary,
              secondary, undergraduate, or postgraduate private schools)</li>
            <li>Social service center establishments (e.g. , day care centers,
              senior citizen centers, homeless shelters, food banks, adoption
              agencies)</li>
            <li>Places of exercise or recreation (e.g. , gymnasiums, health
              spas, bowling alleys, golf courses)</li>
